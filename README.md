# interview-problems

A collection of small problems you may come across in a technical interview, along with my current working solutions.

*JAVA FILES*
To run in your console, type:
  javac beginning_java/HelloWorld.java   // to compile
  java beginning_java.HelloWorld    // to run
Note the different syntax for the compile file path and the run file path.

*C++ FILES*
To run in your console, type:
  make cpp/file-name   //(no file extension) this compiles all the changes you've made since the last compile.
  ./cpp/file-name   //runs the compiled file

*JAVASCRIPT FILES*
To run in the browser terminal:
  place the filename of the algorithm you are working on in javascript/index.html, as the script src.
  open index.html in your browser
  open the browser terminal
  refresh the page to run the code

*BONUS material* is available (unsolved as yet) in:
- reverse-int
- LeastRecentlyUsed-cache
- three-sum
- longest-palindromic-substring can be optimized
