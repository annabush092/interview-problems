# interview-problems

A collection of small problems you may come across in a technical interview, along with my current working solutions.


*C++ FILES*

To run in your console, type:
  make cpp/file-name   //(no file extension) this compiles all the changes you've made since the last compile.
  ./cpp/file-name   //runs the compiled file


*JAVASCRIPT FILES*

To test these out, throw the lines of code into your console or better yet into https://repl.it to mess around with the code yourself.

BONUS material is available (unsolved as yet) in:
- reverse-int
